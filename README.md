## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to add CSS rules in an order to enhance readability of code. This would make it easier for a user to scan through my codes easily since they follow a certain pattern.

### Useful resources

-   [Ordering CSS rules](https://9elements.com/css-rule-order/) - This helped me order my CSS rules. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
